# Sales-Driven Production Workflow Requirements

## Overview
This document outlines the complete workflow requirements for the Hardy Inventory Hub application, detailing the sales-driven process flow from sales order creation through BOM template selection, production planning, inventory verification, and purchase order generation.

## New Workflow Process

### 1. Sales Order Creation
- Create new sales orders as the starting point of the workflow
- Sales team initiates orders based on customer demand and forecasting
- Each sales order requires selection of products to be manufactured
- **REQUIREMENT**: Sales order interface with product selection capabilities

### 2. BOM Template Selection
- When creating a sales order, system prompts: "Which BOM template do you want to create for production?"
- Display available BOM templates based on forecasting and product requirements
- User selects appropriate BOM template for the sales order
- **REQUIREMENT**: BOM template library with forecasting-based recommendations
- Link selected BOM template to the sales order for production planning

### 3. Production Planning & BOM Processing
- Once BOM template is selected, initiate production planning process
- Selected BOM enters production queue
- System analyzes BOM requirements and component specifications
- **REQUIREMENT**: Production planning interface with BOM-based workflow
- Track production status and timeline for each BOM

### 4. Inventory Verification & Stock Checking
- Before production begins, system checks inventory for all BOM components
- Verify availability of each item required in the selected BOM
- Generate inventory status report showing:
  - Available items with sufficient quantity
  - Items with insufficient stock
  - Completely out-of-stock items
- **REQUIREMENT**: Automated inventory checking against BOM requirements

### 5. Purchase Order Generation
- For items not available in inventory or insufficient quantities:
  - Automatically generate purchase order requirements
  - Calculate required quantities based on BOM specifications
  - Create purchase orders for missing/insufficient components
- **REQUIREMENT**: Automated purchase order generation based on inventory gaps
- Track purchase order status and supplier delivery timelines

### 6. Production Workflow Management
- Hold production until all required components are available
- Monitor purchase order fulfillment and inventory updates
- Release production once all BOM components are in stock
- **REQUIREMENT**: Production hold/release system based on component availability

### 7. Workflow Dashboard Visualization
- **REQUIREMENT**: Visual representation on workflow-dashboard of inventory
- Real-time status updates for all workflow stages
- Track progress from initial SKU to final kit production
- Display alerts and notifications for critical workflow points
